# Substructure-Aware Subgraph Reasoning for Inductive Relation Prediction

This repository contains the code and the datasets of **Substructure-Aware Subgraph Reasoning for Inductive Relation Prediction**. Kai Sun, HuaJie Jiang, YongLi Hu, BaoCai Yin

## Dependencies
The code is based on Python 3.7. You can use the following command to create a environment and enter it.
```shell script
conda create --name SASP_ENV python=3.7
source activate SASP_ENV
```
All the required packages can be installed by running 
```shell script
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To test the code, run the following commands.

```shell script
cd code/AUC-PR
bash run_once.sh WN18RR_v1 8 1 2 0.01 0.01 demo_test 10 4
```

Notice that, for the first time you run the code, it would take some time to sample the subgraph. 

## Reproduce the Results

### Usage

```
bash {run_once.sh | run_five.sh} <dataset>  <gamma: margin in the loss function> \
<negative_sample_size> <enclosing_subgraph_hop_number> <learning_rate> <weight_decay> \ 
<experiment_id> <max_epoch> <gpu_id> 
```
